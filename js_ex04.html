// create a JavaScript object that represents a cat. It should have properties for tiredness, hunger, loneliness and happiness.

// Next, write methods that increase and decrease those properties. Call them something that actually represents what would increase or decrease these things, like "feed", "sleep", or "pet".

// Last, write a method that prints out the cat's status in each area.
