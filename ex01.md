Exercise 01 - Translation
=========================

Relations between Javascript and Python have been testy but improving as of late,
so we're going to perform some more delicate diplomacy.
This will challenge your knowledge of both Python and Javascript, but be sure to respect the
various accents and cultural norms, or you'll offend the compilers.
This could result in war between our peoples, so be sure to take a look at
your [python-to-javascript](https://github.com/kb0rg/practice_js1#Python-To-Javascript) dictionary.

Here's our first bit of code from the Python folks - make sure the Javascriptians understand it well.

```python
## Find and print the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

sum = 0
for i in range(1000):
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
        sum += i
print sum

```
